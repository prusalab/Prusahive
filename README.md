A smart DIY beekeeping scale and tracker.

Prusahive is a DIY beehive scale and sensor array for modern hacking beekeepers developed at PrusaLab and deployed in Prague. 
This repo contains firmware for the ESP32, precisely the TTGO T8 v1.7 which we used for the project. Guides, tutorials and 3D files for enclosures can be found on Wikifactory: https://wikifactory.com/@prusalab/prusahive
